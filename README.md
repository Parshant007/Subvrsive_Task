What is done:
===

# I created a gun inventory system for a 2D game where players can choose from multiple types of guns. The system is built using the MVC architecture and the Observer design pattern with delegates.

# 

# Project play:

In this project, players can select different types of guns. The logic is designed to be scalable and extensible, meaning new guns or features can be added in the future without modifying the existing codebase.
